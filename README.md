# CPE-301-Swamp-Cooler-Final-Project-JH
This is my final project. I, Jose Huerta, worked on this project alone. I wasn't able to make it work in it's entirety. I was able to have 0 errors/warnings with my code, but I'm unsure why it doesn't function correctly. I've checked wiring and I believe the wiring to also be correct. I was also unable to get the stepper module driver to function. I have a potentiometer cinnected directly to the given Arduino kit power supply, and from there, I connected the driver module. I didn't get any power once I got everything to start. I had an extra module from a previous class but I had the same result. 
Also I'd like to add this is my first time using github, I have only the readme and code file attached, which I believe were the only requirements. I also didn't know what a commit was, thus the minimal amount of them.
